    * Provide the version your application depends on.
          * You application might need a certain version which might require a higher version or lower version or any version of the package/library. You would need to choose from the dropdown/combo box if your application requires a certain version. Could be _Any, Less than,Less then or equal to,Greater then so on and so forth_.
    * The bit drop down box/combo box is used only for hierarchal order of package dependencies. Which you may prefer a certain package to be exist or a certain package must  and should exists. This can be group using the bitn *OR / AND*. If your uncertain leave it by default.
    * Click the add button when your add to add it to the lists of packages your application depends on.
