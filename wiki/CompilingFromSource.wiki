This page will explain how you can compile Debian Package Maker yourself.

So compiling from source should be pretty easy.

If you prefer to compile DebianPackageMaker using the generated Makefiles just follow the steps on the Details but before that please read the requirements.

       * >= 1.2.4
       * mono-mcs
       * mono-gac

* Building Debian Package Maker using Makefiles *


    * *step 1* Download the source code first. You can obtain this by going to the _Downloads_ sections by click the Downloads tab above.

    * *step 2* Unpack the source code to a place where you're comfortable at.

    * *step 3* Open terminal/console and got to the source code/project folder.

    * *step 4* Type *_./configure_*  
          * This will check your system for some libraries and it will tell you what libraries are missing, if so please install them.
          * optionally you can specify a directory where to install the compiled application by typing *_--prefix=/prefered/path_* you can change the *_/prefered/path_*  to a path of your choice. *_/opt/yourfolder_* is recommended.
         * If it says *_missing_* or *_no_* to the specified libraries/program please install the missing libraries and repeat *_step 4_*.

    * *step 5* Type *_make_* 
         * This will compile the sourcecode and see if there are any errors if errors exists then _Huston I think you've got a problem_. If there were no errors you have now options to *run* it or _install_ it, the later is not recommended.

    * *Running* Type *make run*
         * It should now run if it doesn't make sure compiled it with no errors see _step 4_ and _step 5_.
