#summary Building a debian package using the source/project.

= Introduction =

Building a debian package using source mode is simply building a package out from a source or project. This mode requires you to be patient enough as DebianPackageMaker will do the following for you:

     * Configure the sources/project to be compiled.
     * Compile the source/project for you.
     * And build a debian package after.

Please be informed that configuring and compiling from source will take a lot of time depending on the size/numbers of sourcess/libraries that are needed to be configured and compiled.

*NOTE :*
     * _Source mode requires that the source/project you're going to build a package from must contain a configure scripts ( configure/autogen ), Makefiles and set of rules._
     * _Those scripts will be used for configuring and compiling of sources._
     * _Install script must also exists for Debian Package Maker to successfully create a debian based package._
