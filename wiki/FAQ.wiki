#summary Frequently Asked Question

*Why your application is very confusing compared to _dh_make_ and _dpkg-buildpackage_?*
    * It would be wise not to compare *DebianPackageMaker* with dh_make as it does not uses dh_make. It uses *dpkg-buildpackage* entirely even when building from source.
    * It is expected in every application that one or many will be confused as to how to used it. I doubt it if you're not confused as to how to use *dh_make* from the first time.
    * There's always *first time* for everything that is why the *Help* button and the *[http://code.google.com/p/debianpackagemaker/w/list Wiki]* page was invented to help you do things.

*Why did you make this trivial application when you can just use the CLI?*
     * To you it is trivial maybe but to me it is not.
     * I am very new to Linux OS specially the CLI.
     * I found many applications and games for linux that are free but not all of them are built for a specific distro. Configuring and compiling and running it everytime on CLI would be tedious compared to an application that is integrated on the system in which it is managed by the systems specific package manager. In that way it will be easy to upgrade and track the changes and prevents from any conflicts.
