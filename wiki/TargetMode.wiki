#summary Build package using target mode

= Introduction =

Building a debian package using target mode is simply manually instructing DebianPackageMaker where to copy/install files into what Linux directory.
_e.g.: "/usr","/usr/local" etc._

Most official debian package usually installs their resources/binaries int _"/usr"_ but most of the time you would usually install it in _"/usr/local"_ to prevent in conflicts with the main packages in your system.


= Details =

TargetMode assumes that you have the necessary Linux binaries/resources that you would need to install. Follow the steps below:

*1 Where to install*
    * You must provide an absolute address to where your binaries/resources should be installed in the *Installation Directory Entry.*
    *Example: _"/usr/share/debianpackagemaker"_.

*2 File(s) To Be Installed*
    * You must provide an absolute address to one or all of the files you want it to be installed on the specified installation directory in the *Files to be installed entry*

*3 Add the files*
    * Simple click the *Add installation structures* button to add the specified file to the lists of files to installed.
